# UCLA Radio Station Lights Animator and Controller
Software for the LED light strip in the UCLA Radio broadcasting room.

## Installation:
Both the server and the client were designed to be run on Linux-based
environments (more specifically, Debian-based distros). Although there are ways
to compile/run both on other environments, pieces of the installation script
will need to be run manually to install all of the dependencies.

```shell
git clone https://github.com/uclaradio/uclaradio-lights.git
cd uclaradio-lights/build
./install.sh
```
